# Siri_Chess_Challenge

To run the program the following steps are recommended:
1. git clone the repository link locally
2. cd into your src folder ("cd Siri_Chess_Challenge/src")
3. "javac StartProgram.java" to compile
4. "java StartProgram" to run the program
5. You will be walked through a series of prompts (see subpoints below) that will ask you which piece you would like to test, and its starting and ending positions.
6. The program will output whether or not the ending position is reachable from the starting position, the minimum number of turns required to reach this position, and the path taken for this traversal.

  a). Enter choice number (1 = King, 2 = Bishop, 3 = Knight, 4 = All)\
  b). Enter starting row (between 0 and 7)\
  c). Enter statring column (between 0 and 7)\
  d). Enter ending row (between 0 and 7)\
  e). Enter ending column (between 0 and 7)\

(This program assumes the board is not otherwise populated with any other pieces that might obstruct its path)

Enjoy!
